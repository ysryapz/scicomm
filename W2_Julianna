Currently, the gist of our simulation is:
1) Create a bunch of circles on the sphere
2) Make the circles move
3) As the circles are moving, slowly increase the radius of the circle
4) If overlap occurs, push circles such that that the overlap will be gone
5) When circles can't increase further without overlapping, our answer is there :)

For this week's contribution, I would like to talk about 
1) growth
2) end condition

GROWTH:
